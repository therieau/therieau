- 👋 Hi, I’m @therieau
- 👀 I’m interested in AppleScript, shell scripting, and PowerShell
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all of the above at the same time because Mac management at my workplace is largely a manual process and pretty tedious.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on managing Macs in a Microsoft Azure environment
- 📫 You can reach me by sending an email to info at a domain called bobtherieau which can be found at the top level of com.
